# Decorator Demo

This is a repo that I used to play around with how [JS decorators](https://github.com/wycats/javascript-decorators) work. They are pretty awesome and I hope they make it to the language.

## To Run

```
npm install
npm start
```

`index.js` is the file that uses the decorators and `decorators.js` is the decorator definitions. The decorators are not as abstracted as they could be so its easier to see what is going on.
